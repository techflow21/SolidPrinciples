# Implementation of SOLID Principles

# 1. For Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) 
The Customer class is responsible for handling customer information, and the Order class is responsible for handling customer orders. Each class has a single responsibility and does not handle tasks that are not related to its specific purpose. This follows the Single Responsibility Principle and makes the code easier to maintain and understand.

# 2. For Open/Close Principle (OCP)
